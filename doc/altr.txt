==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*altr-introduction*

*altr* is a Vim plugin to switch files easily.

Suppose that you are developing a Vim plugin which is called "foo".  You often
edit a set of specific files such as "autoload/foo.vim", "doc/foo.txt",
"plugin/foo.vim", etc.  Sometimes one of the files is not displayed in any
window.  So you have to open the missing file explicitly.  But there are many
ways to open a file.  How do you open it?  |:edit|, |:buffer|, or your
favorite buffer-management plugin?

Whatever you choose, you have to type some keys to specify what the missing
file is.  So there is no way to open the missing file WITHOUT INTERACTION.
You'll probably wish if there is a command to open the missing file without
interaction.  This plugin, altr, provides the command.  For example:

- Want to open "autoload/foo.vim" while you are editing "plugin/foo.vim"?
  Type |<Plug>(altr-forward)|.
- Then want to open "doc/foo.txt"?
  Type |<Plug>(altr-forward)| again.
- And typed |<Plug>(altr-forward)| too much?
  Type |<Plug>(altr-back)| to back.

The best keys and Ex commands to open the missing file depend on your tastes.
So that altr doesn't define neither the default keys nor the default Ex
commands.  See |altr-examples| for how to set up keys and Ex commands.

There are several |altr-default-rules| for convenience.  You can also
customize what files to be infered with |altr#define()|.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

MAPPINGS					*altr-mappings*

The following key mappings are defined in all modes.

<Plug>(altr-back)				*<Plug>(altr-back)*
			Same as |altr#back()|.

<Plug>(altr-forward)				*<Plug>(altr-forward)*
			Same as |altr#forward()|.




==============================================================================
RULES						*altr-rules*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE DEFINITION					*altr-rule-definition*

A "rule" consists of three "patterns":

- Current pattern which is used to detect the type of the current buffer.
- Forward pattern which is used to find the missing file on the forward side.
- Back pattern which is used to find the missing file on the back side.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN DEFINITION				*altr-pattern-definition*

A pattern is a string to express a set of paths (to files).
In a pattern, some characters have special meaning:

%
	For current pattern:
		Matches 0 or more characters.
	For other patterns:
		Matches characters which are matched in current pattern.

*
	For all patterns:
		Matches 0 or more characters.

/
	For all patterns:
		Matches both "/" and "\".

		So that patterns should be written with only "/" as a path
		separator to use the same rule definitions every platform,
		especially both Windows environment and non-Windows
		environment.

Other character
	For all patterns:
		Matches the character itself.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFERENCE ALGORITHM				*altr-inference-algorithm*

The missing file is inferred according to the current buffer and existing
rules with the following algorithm:

1. Match the current buffer name against a current pattern of each rule.

   a. If a matching pattern is found, go to the step 2.

   b. Otherwise, it is an error.

   Note that patterns are matched in the order of priorities of their rules.
   See also |altr-rule-priorities|.

2. Check the content of the matching (current) pattern.

   a. If the current pattern contains "*", list paths which match to the
      current pattern, then use a path which is next to the current buffer
      name as the missing file.

      If there is no path that is next to the current buffer name, go to the
      step 2.b.

   b. Otherwise, list paths with one of the forward pattern and the back
      pattern for the current pattern, then use a path which is next to the
      current buffer name as the missing file.

      If there is no path that is next to the current buffer name, repeat this
      step with the forward patten of the forward pattern or the back pattern
      of the back pattern.

      If a proper path is not found in these steps, use the "next" rule which
      has less priority than the current rule.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE PRIORITIES					*altr-rule-priorities*

The priority of a rule is a number.  Higher value means higher priority.

The priority of a rule is calculated as follows:

- Count "*" in the current pattern of the rule (= s).
- Count "%" in the current pattern of the rule (= p).
- Count other character in the current pattern of the rule (= c).

The priority of the rule is: 1.0 * c + 0.5 * p + 0.1 * s

If two or more rules have the same priority, those rules are sorted by current
pattern with dictionary order.

For example:

- The priority of pattern "ftplugin/%.vim" is 14.0.
- The priority of pattern "ftplugin/%/*.vim" is 15.1.
- The priority of pattern "ftplugin/%_*.vim" is 15.1.
- Though "ftplugin/%/*.vim" and "ftplugin/%_*.vim" has the same priority,
  "ftplugin/%/*.vim" is applied first because it is smaller than
  "ftplugin/%_*.vim" with dictionary order.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE EXAMPLES					*altr-rule-examples*

						*altr-rule-example-1*
CASE 1: Simple patterns with single % ~

Suppose that we have the following configuration:
>
	call altr#remove_all()
	call altr#define('plugin/%.vim', 'doc/%.txt')
<
The following rules are defined by the configuration:

	back pattern    | current pattern | forward pattern
	----------------+-----------------+----------------
	doc/%.txt       | plugin/%.vim    | doc/%.txt
	plugin/%.vim    | doc/%.txt       | plugin/%.vim

If the current buffer name is "plugin/foo.vim", both |altr#forward()| and
|altr#back()| opens "doc/foo.txt".

						*altr-rule-example-2*
CASE 2: Patterns with * ~

Suppose that we have the following configuration:
>
	call altr#remove_all()
	call altr#define('ftplugin/%.vim',
	\                'ftplugin/%_*.vim',
	\                'ftplugin/%/*.vim')
<
The following rules are defined by the configuration:

	back pattern     | current pattern  | forward pattern
	-----------------+------------------+-----------------
	ftplugin/%/*.vim | ftplugin/%.vim   | ftplugin/%_*.vim
	ftplugin/%.vim   | ftplugin/%_*.vim | ftplugin/%/*.vim
	ftplugin/%/*.vim | ftplugin/%/*.vim | ftplugin/%.vim

And suppose that the following files exist:

- ftplugin/foo.vim
- ftplugin/foo_mine.vim
- ftplugin/foo_yours.vim
- ftplugin/foo/bar.vim
- ftplugin/foo/baz.vim

If the current buffer name is "ftplugin/foo.vim", |altr#forward()| opens files
in the following order:

1. ftplugin/foo_mine.vim
2. ftplugin/foo_yours.vim
3. ftplugin/foo/bar.vim
4. ftplugin/foo/baz.vim
5. ftplugin/foo.vim

And |altr#back()| opens files in the following order:

1. ftplugin/foo/baz.vim
2. ftplugin/foo/bar.vim
3. ftplugin/foo_yours.vim
4. ftplugin/foo_mine.vim
5. ftplugin/foo.vim

						*altr-rule-example-3*
CASE 3: Patterns with multiple %s ~

Suppose that we have the following configuration:
>
	call altr#remove_all()
	call altr#define('autoload/%/%.vim',
	\                'doc/%-%.txt',
	\                'plugin/%/%.vim')
<
The following rules are defined by the configuration:

	back pattern     | current pattern  | forward pattern
	-----------------+------------------+-----------------
	plugin/%/%.vim   | autoload/%/%.vim | doc/%-%.txt
	autoload/%/%.vim | doc/%-%.txt      | plugin/%/%.vim
	doc/%-%.txt      | plugin/%/%.vim   | autoload/%/%.vim

And suppose that the following files exist:

- autoload/textobj/bar.vim
- autoload/textobj/foo.vim
- doc/textobj-bar.txt
- doc/textobj-foo.txt
- plugin/textobj/bar.vim
- plugin/textobj/foo.vim

If the current buffer name is "autoload/textobj/foo.vim", |altr#forward()|
opens files in the following order:

1. doc/textobj-foo.txt
2. plugin/textobj/foo.vim
3. autoload/textobj/foo.vim

And |altr#back()| opens files in the following order:

1. plugin/textobj/foo.vim
2. doc/textobj-foo.txt
3. autoload/textobj/foo.vim

CHANGELOG					*altr-changelog*

0.1.0	2014-03-15T15:20:17+09:00		*altr-changelog-0.1.0*
	- Support multiple %s in patterns.  See also |altr-rule-example-3|.
	- Add default rules for Vim plugins which are based on
	  vim-operator-user and vim-textobj-user.
	- Improve messages for cases when there is no next/previous file.
	- Fix to simplify paths shown in status lines (with %f).  In old
	  versions, unvisited files are opened by :edit with absolute paths
	  even if the files are below the current directory.  It causes long
	  paths are shown in status lines.
	- Fix the default rules for Vim syntax files.  In old versions, syntax
	  files in nested directories like "syntax/foo/bar.vim" are not
	  detected properly.

0.0.3	2013-06-30T17:34:48+09:00		*altr-changelog-0.0.3*
	- Fix |altr#forward()| and |altr#back()| to switch to a proper file
	  if the current file exists in the current directory.  (Thank @deris
	  for the patch.)
	- Fix wrong usage document for |altr#show()|.  (Thank @thinca for the
	  report).

0.0.2	2012-09-01T15:07:32+09:00		*altr-changelog-0.0.2*
	- Add default rules for C++ and Objective-C.
	  (Thank Alejandro Exojo for the patch.)
	- Fix |altr#forward()| and |altr#back()| to distinguish similar paths.
	  There was some possibility to swith to wrong buffers.

0.0.0	2011-05-20T23:39:12+09:00		*altr-changelog-0.0.0*
	- Initial version.
